An Unreal Engine 4 Machine Learning Project. The default project is a ANN classifying poker hands. Although, there might be future machine learning things.

This contains 2 plugins and an unreal engine 4 project that combines the two. The first plugin is a Deck of Cards, it has a plethora of functionality for the use of a deck of cards. It also contains a few simple poker game functions like anyalzing the rank of a poker hand. The second plugin is a simple but powerful artificial neural network.

We will try and feed it generative labeled data and predict the ranks of any given hand of cards.

In the future i hope to explore many other machine learning fun. Like generating anything from music to art, maybe we could create a robot to create games and finally have one of those Make a Game button.
